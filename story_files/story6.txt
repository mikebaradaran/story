### **Stitch, Lilo, Kimberly, and Lorenzo: The Day of the Coconut Chaos**

It was a sunny afternoon in **Hawai‘i**, and Lilo was lying on the warm sand outside her house, listening to Elvis on her little record player. Stitch was trying to dance along but somehow managed to trip over his own feet and roll into a bush.

“Stitch, you’re supposed to *sway*, not *somersault*,” Lilo giggled.

Just then, a bright red moped skidded to a stop near the driveway. On it were **Kimberly**, Lilo’s new pen pal from California, and her cousin **Lorenzo**, who had just moved to the island. Kimberly jumped off, her hair flying in the breeze, and waved excitedly.

“Hey, Lilo! Ready for the **surf lesson**?” she asked.
“Totally!” Lilo said. “Stitch is coming, too!”

Lorenzo, who was holding a coconut smoothie in each hand, eyed Stitch suspiciously. “Uh… is that a… dog?”
Stitch puffed out his chest. “*Ih!* Dog!” He wagged his ears like a tail.

The group decided to walk down to the beach, with Stitch bouncing around happily—until he spotted a **coconut stand**. Within thirty seconds, he had devoured six coconuts and was trying to juggle three more.

“Stitch, no! You’re gonna—” Lilo started, but it was too late.

One coconut slipped, rolled downhill, and crashed into a cart of beach balls. The balls went flying down the beach like a rainbow avalanche. Tourists screamed. A sandcastle competition exploded into chaos. Kimberly and Lorenzo dove to catch runaway coconuts while Stitch rode a giant beach ball straight into the ocean.

By the time they all caught their breath, Stitch was floating on his back with a coconut in each hand, proudly victorious. Kimberly laughed so hard she nearly fell into the water.

“Well,” Lorenzo said, brushing sand off his shirt, “I guess that’s one way to… start a surf lesson?”

Lilo grinned and shook her head. “Welcome to life with Stitch. This is… pretty normal, actually.”

Kimberly and Lorenzo exchanged a look, then burst out laughing. Even though the day hadn’t gone as planned, it turned into a story they’d tell for years—the day Stitch turned a quiet beach trip into a **coconut-fueled carnival of chaos**.

And, somewhere in the distance, Stitch burped contentedly.
