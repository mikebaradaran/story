Once upon a time, in a sparkly kingdom 🏰
with clouds made of marshmallows ⛅
there was a kind and lovely princess named Bella 🫅🏻

Princess Bella was having a sleepover 😴🛌🏻at her cosy castle
Her best friend Lorenzo was already there
wearing his soft pyjamas
and holding his favourite teddy bear 🐻

Another good friend, a princess 🫅🏻 named Kimberly, came too! 
She wore a crown 👑 with pink glitter 
and brought her bedtime Hello Kitty 🐰🐇

Before bedtime, Princess Bella said
"It is almost time to sleep!"  😴

But Kimberly remembered something very important
"I need to brush my teeth!" she said 🪥😬

She took her toothbrush 🪥 
and brushed side to side, side to side 
just like she was taught 
Sparkle!✨ Sparkle!✨ Her teeth were clean and shiny ✨

When they were all snuggled in their blankets 🛏️
Princess Bella used a little magic to help everyone sleep 🧝🏻
She whispered sleepy words and waved her glowing wand 🪄

But—oh no! too much magic! 🔮🔥
A little puff of sparkles filled the room 🔥, and everyone gave a tiny cough cough! 🤧😰
"Oops!" giggled Bella. "Too much sparkle!"

They all laughed, then cuddled up again. 
This time, Bella used just a little magic
and soon, everyone was fast asleep… 
dreaming of unicorns 🦄🦄🦄, pancakes  🎂, and flying kittens 😹😻😽

The End.

Original story by Kimberly:
There was once a princess called Bella.
And Lorenzo was with her. And they had sleepover in the house. 
Kimberly was a little princess and she was a good friend of Bella.
Kimberly was also coming to the sleep over.
They all want to sleep.
Kimberly had to brush her teeth before going to sleep. 
Must brush side to side.
Bella helped them to sleep by using magic. And they coughed because she used too much magic power.
