🌞 One sunny day, Bluey 🐶💙 and her little sister Bingo 🐶🧡 were so excited 😄 
because they were going on a camping trip 🏕️🌲 with Mom 👩🐶 and Dad 👨🐶!

They packed their backpacks 🎒 with sandwiches 🥪 and water 💧 
and a special toy — a compass 🧭 that Grandpa 👴🐶 had given them 🎁.

When they arrived at the camping spot 🚗⛺
they set up their tent under a big shady tree 🌳🛖. 
After lunch 🍎🥪, Bluey had a brilliant idea 💡.

Let’s explore the forest! she exclaimed 🌲🧭✨.
Bingo’s eyes 👀 sparkled ✨ with excitement!

As they walked 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️ through the forest 🌿
the air was fresh 🌬️ and the birds chirped happily🐦🎶
Bluey led the way 🧭, using the compass to guide them 🗺️.

Suddenly, they heard a soft sound 👂 like water splashing 💦🌊.

Do you hear that, Bingo? asked Bluey.
Bingo nodded eagerly 😃🐶.

The sisters hurried 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️ toward the sound, 
and soon they stumbled upon a hidden waterfall! 🌈💦🏞️
It was beautiful, with water cascading down the rocks ⛰️ 
and a rainbow shining through the mist 🌈🌫️.

Joy filled their hearts ❤️ as they squealed together Wowww! 😍🎉

Let’s play in the water! suggested Bingo 🐶💦.

They splashed around 💦💃, feeling the cool water on their fur 🐾❄️.
Bluey noticed something shiny ✨ near the edge of the waterfall 👀.

She bent down 🤏 to take a closer look 🔍 and found strange markings on a rock 🪨.

Coco and Rusty were here! Write your name if you find this place! ✍️📝 it said.

That’s so cool! 😄 said Bingo.
Let’s write our names too! 🐾🖊️
