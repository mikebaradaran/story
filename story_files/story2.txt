The big fox ran. 🦊
The sun was hot. 🌅

The fox saw two red hats 👒⛑️
One hat for you ⛑️
the fox said 🎩
One hat for me!

The fox put his hat on 🦊⛑️
The hat was too big! ⛑️
Oh no!

The hat hid his eye. 😵‍💫
The fox ran and hit a log
🌴🦊

Are you OK? a cat said. 😽
Yes, but my hat is not!
The fox sat and cut the hat. ✂️

Now it is fit!  👍🏻
The fox was so happy! 😆🙌🏻
The end! 🔚
